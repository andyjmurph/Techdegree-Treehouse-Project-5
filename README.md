#Refactor CSS to Sass

In this project I had to convert a CSS stylesheet to Sass by refactoring the stylesheet from the "Responsive Layout" [Responsive Portfolio Project](http://andyjmurph.github.io/Techdegree-Treehouse-Project-2) using SCSS partials, variables, extends, and mixins.

##Requirements

* Create a 'scss' folder in your "Responsive Layout" project.
* Convert the CSS stylesheet to an SCSS stylesheet, then place it inside the 'scss' folder.
* Run Sass from the console or with a tool like CodeKit, Workspaces, or any of these.
* In the 'scss' folder, create subfolders to organize your CSS code into Sass partial files.
* Group related sections of CSS into SCSS partials.
* Import your partials into your project's main SCSS file.
* Find repeating patterns in the stylesheet and extract them into placeholder selectors, then extend them wherever necessary.
* Create variables for repeating values. At a minimum create variables for colors, font-sizes and font-family values
* Write mixins for media queries
* Create at least one example of a nested Sass rule.
* Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.
